## Getting Started

### Built With

- **Express** - The web framework used.
- **MongoDB** - Database.
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js
- npm
- MongoDB

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine.**
   

2. **Navigate into the project directory.**


3. **Install the necessary packages.** Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

npm i express express-handlebars body-parser mongoose multer bcrypt express-session connect-mongodb-session


This command installs Express, Express Handlebars, Body-parser, Mongoose, Multer, Bcrypt, Express-session, and Connect-mongodb-session.

4. **Update the MongoDB connection string.** Open the file where the MongoDB connection is established and change the connection string to your MongoDB instance. 

```javascript
// Replace the connection string with your MongoDB connection string
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/condodb", { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
```

Ensure the database name condodb is correct. Adjust the connection string as necessary for your environment.

Set up a MongoDB database and ensure it's running. Connect to mongodb://localhost:27017.

Start the server. Run node app.js to start the application.

Import initial data. From the "data" folder, import condos.json, reviews.json, and users.json to the condos, reviews, and users collections respectively under condodb in the database.

Access the application. You should now have the server running on http://localhost:3000.

By following these steps, your development environment should be up and running, allowing you to start using or contributing to the Condo Bro Review Application.
